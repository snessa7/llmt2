# LLMT2 Development Failures

This document tracks features that were attempted but failed during development, along with the reasons for failure and potential solutions for future implementation.

## Message Export Feature (Attempted: September 6, 2025)

### What Was Attempted
- Implemented SwiftUI `fileExporter` modifier for exporting chat history
- Created `ChatExportDocument` struct conforming to `FileDocument` protocol
- Added export button to UI with proper state management
- Used modern SwiftUI file export APIs instead of legacy `NSSavePanel`

### Why It Failed
1. **App Crashes**: The export functionality caused the app to crash consistently
2. **Multiple Initialization Issues**: The `ChatViewModel` was being initialized multiple times, causing memory issues
3. **SwiftUI File Export Complexity**: The `fileExporter` modifier proved more complex than expected in this context
4. **FoundationModels Integration Conflicts**: The export feature seemed to interfere with the `LanguageModelSession` initialization

### Technical Details
- **Error Pattern**: App would crash with "zsh: abort" when export button was clicked
- **Root Cause**: Likely related to SwiftUI's file export system conflicting with the app's existing architecture
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Used SwiftUI's native `fileExporter` instead of `NSSavePanel`
  - Added proper error handling and state management
  - Implemented `FileDocument` protocol correctly
  - Added comprehensive logging

### Files Modified
- `llmt2/ContentView.swift`: Added export functionality, then removed
- Added `UniformTypeIdentifiers` import
- Created `ChatExportDocument` struct
- Added export button and state management

### Future Implementation Suggestions
1. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using a simpler text file writing approach
2. **Separate Export Service**: Create a dedicated export service class
3. **Async Export**: Implement export as a background operation
4. **User Feedback**: Add better progress indicators and error messages
5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing before adding to main app

### Status
- **Status**: CANCELLED
- **Date Removed**: September 6, 2025
- **Reason**: Causing app crashes and instability
- **Future**: Will revisit after core app stability is improved

## Voice Settings Sheet Dismissal (RESOLVED: September 6, 2025)

### What Was Attempted
- Enhanced TTS voice quality with better voice selection and speech parameters
- Added comprehensive voice settings panel with 180+ available voices
- Implemented voice selection, speech rate, pitch, and volume controls
- Added voice settings sheet with proper dismissal mechanisms

### Initial Problem
1. **Sheet Dismissal Issues**: The voice settings sheet did not dismiss properly
2. **Done Button Not Working**: Clicking "Done" button did not close the sheet
3. **Escape Key Not Working**: Pressing Escape key did not dismiss the sheet
4. **User Trapped**: User could not exit the voice settings interface without force-quitting

### Root Cause Analysis
- **Error Pattern**: Sheet opened correctly but could not be dismissed through normal UI interactions
- **Root Cause**: **Conflicting dismissal mechanisms** - Using both `@Environment(\.dismiss)` and `@Binding var showVoiceSettings: Bool` together caused conflicts
- **SwiftUI Best Practice Violation**: According to Context 7 documentation, you should use **either** the environment dismiss action **or** the binding, but not both

### Solution Applied
**Used Context 7 to find the proper SwiftUI pattern:**
1. **Removed conflicting binding**: Eliminated `@Binding var showVoiceSettings: Bool` from `VoiceSettingsView`
2. **Used proper environment dismiss**: Kept only `@Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss`
3. **Updated dismissal calls**: Changed all dismissal actions to use `dismiss()` instead of setting binding
4. **Simplified sheet presentation**: Removed binding parameter from sheet presentation

### Technical Implementation
```swift
// BEFORE (conflicting approaches):
struct VoiceSettingsView: View {
    @Binding var showVoiceSettings: Bool  // ❌ Conflicting
    @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss  // ❌ Conflicting
    
    Button("Done") {
        showVoiceSettings = false  // ❌ Wrong approach
    }
}

// AFTER (proper SwiftUI pattern):
struct VoiceSettingsView: View {
    @Environment(\.dismiss) private var dismiss  // ✅ Correct
    
    Button("Done") {
        dismiss()  // ✅ Correct approach
    }
}
```

### Files Modified
- `llmt2/ContentView.swift`: Fixed voice settings dismissal mechanism
- Removed conflicting binding approach
- Implemented proper SwiftUI environment dismiss pattern

### Current Status
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY RESOLVED
- **Voice Selection**: ✅ Working (180+ voices available, selection works)
- **Speech Parameters**: ✅ Working (rate, pitch, volume controls functional)
- **Sheet Dismissal**: ✅ WORKING (Done button and Escape key both work properly)
- **User Experience**: Excellent (smooth dismissal, no user trapping)

### Key Learnings
1. **SwiftUI Best Practices**: Use either environment dismiss OR binding, never both
2. **Context 7 Value**: External documentation tools can provide crucial SwiftUI pattern guidance
3. **Dismissal Patterns**: `@Environment(\.dismiss)` is the preferred approach for sheet dismissal
4. **Testing Importance**: Proper testing revealed the conflicting dismissal mechanisms

### Status
- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED
- **Date Resolved**: September 6, 2025
- **Solution**: Used Context 7 to identify proper SwiftUI dismissal pattern
- **Result**: Fully functional voice settings with proper dismissal
